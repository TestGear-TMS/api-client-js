# TestGear TMS API client for JavaScript
![TestGear](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/testgear-tms/api-client-js/main/images/banner.png)

# Getting Started

## Installation
```
npm install testgear-api-client
```

# Usage

## Configuration

To use client you need to provide configuration to `Client`:
```ts
const client = new Client({
  url: 'http://example.com',
  configurationId: 'configurationId',
  privateToken: 'privateToken',
  projectId: 'projectId',
  testRunId: 'testRunId',
});
```

After configuration is done you can access different clients from `Client` object and then use methods to control TestGear.

## Examples
```ts
await client.createAutotest(autotest);
await client.updateAutotest(autotest);
await client.linkToWorkItem(autotestId, workItem);
await client.createTestRun(testRun);
await client.startTestRun(testRunId);
await client.loadTestRunResults(testRunId, results);
await client.completeTestRun(testRunId);
```
